          <h4 class="card-title">Rory Gilmore</h4>
          <p class="card-text">A main character in the show Gilmore Girls. She is a student at Chilton in the beginning of the series.</p>
          <p class="extra"> Rory is the only daughter of Lorelai Gilmore and the first-born daughter of Christopher Hayden. She was born October 8, 1984, in Hartford, Connecticut, at 4:03 am. Every year at that exact time, Lorelai wakes Rory to tell her the story of her birth. Because Lorelai gave birth to Rory when she was only sixteen, the two are more like friends than mother and daughter. Rory shares her mother's taste in junk food, coffee, movies, music, and much more. She spent her first months living with her mother at her grandparents' mansion until her mother ran away. She spent the rest of her childhood in the Independence Inn in Stars Hollow, where her mother initially worked as a maid. The two lived in the potting shed behind the inn, where Jackson's cousin, Rune, lived in later seasons. Eventually, Lorelai was able to buy a nice house where Rory spent her adolescent years. Rory had little contact with her grandparents until she started attending Chilton.</p>
